### SUMMARY

I was always interested in IT field despite the fact that I have education and experience in accounting. In order to understand if the field is suitable for me, I started taking online courses in my spare time, learning by myself.  Thus, I started with web testing courses, including web accessibility. Over the time, I understood that I prefer to create online applications and decided to focus on web development. My self-education helps me to understand and use the following web technologies: JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. Moreover, based on listed languages/scripts I was able to create my first project – Gift Form (the link is provided below in PROJECT section).

As previously mentioned, I have a financial background and bachelor’s degree in Economics. I strongly believe that my education and current knowledge can help me productively identify business, functional and technical requirements. In addition, my previous work experience enabled me to develop strong communication skills as well as business knowledge in the field, especially deep analysis, exploration of the issues and understanding clients’ needs. I have excellent problem-solving and analytical skills, responsible and highly organized person, who enjoys teamwork and is ready to face any challenge.
